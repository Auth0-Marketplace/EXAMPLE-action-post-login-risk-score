# Risk Score Example Action Integration

This repo contains an example for an Action that sends Auth0 profile data to a risk score API and makes decisions based on the response. The code in this repo is meant to be used as a starting point for an Action integration with a similar purpose and should not be used as-is in production. 

Please see the [Post Login Action Integration template](https://github.com/Auth0-Marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-post-login/) for information on how to test, modify, and submit your completed integration.

**Please Note:** The code in this repository should be used as an example to help write an Action integration, not used directly in production.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
